# Digital Subscription Manager - Frontend Plan

## Problem Analysis & Purpose
A modern, frontend-only subscription management application that helps users track and optimize their digital subscriptions. The app focuses on providing a seamless experience for managing subscription costs, categories, and shared expenses, all while maintaining data locally in the browser.

## Core Features
- Subscription CRUD operations with localStorage persistence
- Smart expense analytics with monthly/annual breakdowns
- Multi-duration subscription support
- Tech-focused categorization system
- Advanced sorting and filtering
- **Standout Feature**: AI-powered subscription insights using GPT-4o
  - Smart categorization and organization
  - Cost optimization suggestions
  - Usage pattern analysis
  - Shared subscription recommendations

## Technical Stack & Data Structure
- Frontend: React 19 with Tailwind CSS
- Storage: localStorage with the following structure:
```javascript
{
  subscriptions: [{
    id: string,
    name: string,
    cost: number,
    currency: string,
    renewalDate: string,
    duration: string,
    category: string,
    type: string,
    isShared: boolean,
    sharedWith: string[],
    splitAmount: number,
    notes: string
  }],
  categories: [{
    id: string,
    name: string,
    color: string
  }],
  settings: {
    defaultCurrency: string,
    theme: 'light' | 'dark'
  }
}
```

## MVP Implementation Strategy
1. Initial Setup (Use bulk_file_writer)
   - Create React project structure with Tailwind CSS
   - Implement localStorage utility functions
   - Set up basic routing and layouts

2. Core Features (Switch to str_replace_editor)
   - Build subscription management components
   - Implement data persistence layer
   - Add sorting and filtering functionality
   - Create expense calculation utilities

3. UI Implementation
   - Design responsive dashboard layout
   - Create interactive subscription cards
   - Implement forms with validation
   - Add toast notifications
   - Design loading states and animations

4. AI Integration
   - Set up GPT-4o connection
   - Implement subscription analysis
   - Add smart recommendations
   - Create insights dashboard

## Development Guidelines
- Use bulk_file_writer for initial setup (up to 300 lines total)
- Switch to str_replace_editor for feature implementation
- Focus on component reusability
- Maintain clean, documented code
- Prioritize UI polish and responsiveness

## <Clarification Required>
1. Should the application support multiple currencies or use a single default?
2. What is the required GPT-4o API endpoint and key format?
3. Should we implement data export/import functionality?
4. Are there specific subscription providers that need special handling?

## Testing Strategy
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Thorough localStorage interaction testing
- Manual testing for AI features
